Title: Rosie Rabbit's Magic Garden

[SCENE: A small rabbit standing in front of a tiny, empty garden patch]
Rosie Rabbit had a little patch of dirt behind her burrow. She dreamed of growing a beautiful garden.

[SCENE: Rosie looking at a packet of seeds with wonder and excitement]
One spring day, she found a packet of magic seeds. "Plant us and share with love," the packet said.

[SCENE: Rosie carefully digging small holes and planting seeds one by one]
Rosie planted each seed carefully, patting the soft earth on top.

[SCENE: Rosie watering the seeds with a tiny watering can every morning]
Every morning, she watered her seeds gently. "Please grow, little seeds," she whispered.

[SCENE: Days passing with no sprouts, Rosie looking worried at the empty soil]
Days went by, but nothing happened. Rosie felt sad. Maybe the magic wasn't working.

[SCENE: Rosie's neighbor, a grumpy badger, walking by and looking at the empty patch]
Her neighbor Badger walked by. "Gardens need more than water," he grumbled. "They need patience."

[SCENE: Rosie continuing to care for the garden, now with a determined look]
Rosie didn't give up. She kept watering, kept hoping, and kept believing.

[SCENE: Tiny green sprouts finally poking through the soil, Rosie jumping with joy]
Then one morning - tiny green sprouts! Rosie jumped so high with happiness!

[SCENE: The garden growing bigger with colorful flowers and vegetables]
The garden grew and grew! Beautiful flowers bloomed, and yummy carrots appeared.

[SCENE: Rosie sharing carrots with Badger, who is now smiling]
Rosie remembered the packet said "share with love." She gave some carrots to Badger, who smiled!

[SCENE: All the forest animals gathered around Rosie's garden, everyone happy and sharing]
Soon everyone visited Rosie's garden. She shared her vegetables with all her friends.

[SCENE: Rosie surrounded by her beautiful garden and all her friends]
The end. Remember, the best things grow when we add patience, care, and sharing!
