Title: The Brave Little Rabbit

[SCENE: A cozy burrow under a big oak tree with a rabbit family inside]
In a cozy burrow under a big oak tree lived a little rabbit named Rosie with her family.

[SCENE: A small white rabbit looking scared at shadows on the wall]
Rosie was afraid of many things. She was scared of the dark, scared of thunder, and scared of the forest.

[SCENE: Rosie's rabbit siblings hopping confidently through the meadow]
Her brothers and sisters would hop through the meadow without any fear, but Rosie stayed close to home.

[SCENE: Rosie's mother rabbit looking lovingly at Rosie]
"Being brave doesn't mean you're not scared," her mother told her. "It means you try even when you're afraid."

[SCENE: A tiny baby bird fallen from its nest, crying on the ground]
One day, Rosie heard a tiny cry. A baby bird had fallen from its nest and couldn't fly back up!

[SCENE: Rosie looking up at the tall tree, then at the scared baby bird]
The nest was high in a tall tree. Rosie felt scared, but the baby bird needed help.

[SCENE: Rosie taking a deep breath, her little heart beating fast]
Rosie took a deep breath. Her heart was beating fast, but she remembered her mother's words.

[SCENE: Rosie carefully climbing up the tree trunk, determination in her eyes]
Step by step, Rosie climbed up the tree. She didn't look down. She just kept going.

[SCENE: Rosie gently placing the baby bird back in its nest with the mother bird watching gratefully]
Finally, she reached the nest and gently placed the baby bird inside. The mother bird chirped happily!

[SCENE: Rosie climbing down safely, feeling proud and happy]
Rosie climbed down carefully, feeling something new inside her chest. She felt proud!

[SCENE: Rosie hopping through the meadow with her siblings, no longer staying behind]
From that day on, Rosie wasn't as scared anymore. She learned that being brave meant helping others, even when you're afraid.

[SCENE: All the forest animals cheering for Rosie, who stands tall with a big smile]
The end. Remember, you are braver than you believe, and kindness gives us courage!
