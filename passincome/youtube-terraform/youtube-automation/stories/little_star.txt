Title: The Little Star Who Found a Friend

[SCENE: A dark night sky filled with twinkling stars of all sizes]
High up in the velvet night sky, thousands of stars twinkled and danced together.

[SCENE: A tiny star with a sad face, smaller than all other stars around it]
Among them was Twinkle, the tiniest star of all. She often felt lonely because the other stars seemed so far away.

[SCENE: A little girl with pigtails looking out her bedroom window at the stars]
Down on Earth, a little girl named Maya loved to watch the stars from her window every night before bed.

[SCENE: Maya pointing at the smallest star in the sky with wonder in her eyes]
One night, Maya noticed the smallest star blinking softly. "Hello little star," she whispered. "You're my favorite one."

[SCENE: Twinkle the star glowing brighter with happiness, with a smile on her face]
Up in the sky, Twinkle felt warm inside. Someone had noticed her! She began to glow a little brighter.

[SCENE: Maya waving at the star from her window, wearing pajamas]
Every night after that, Maya would wave to Twinkle before going to sleep. "Goodnight, little star," she would say.

[SCENE: Twinkle twinkling in a special pattern, like she's waving back]
And every night, Twinkle would twinkle in a special pattern, like she was waving back to her friend.

[SCENE: Maya sleeping peacefully in her bed with starlight streaming through the window]
Maya would fall asleep with a smile, knowing her star friend was watching over her.

[SCENE: Twinkle glowing happily next to other stars who now seem closer and friendlier]
Twinkle no longer felt alone. She had found the best friend in the whole universe, even if they were very far apart.

[SCENE: The night sky with Twinkle shining the brightest among all the stars]
And from that day on, Twinkle became the brightest little star in the sky, all because of one little girl's kindness.

[SCENE: Maya and Twinkle both smiling, connected by a gentle beam of starlight]
The end. Remember, no matter how small you are, there's always someone out there who thinks you're special.
