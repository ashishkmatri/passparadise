Title: Luna the Sleepy Cloud

[SCENE: A soft evening sky with fluffy clouds floating peacefully]
High up in the evening sky floated the softest, fluffiest clouds you ever did see.

[SCENE: A small, extra-fluffy cloud with sleepy eyes named Luna]
The smallest cloud was named Luna. She had the most important job of all - helping children fall asleep.

[SCENE: Luna floating over a village as the sun begins to set]
Every evening, Luna would float over the village, getting ready for bedtime.

[SCENE: Children in their beds looking up through windows at the darkening sky]
As the sky grew dark, children everywhere would climb into their cozy beds.

[SCENE: Luna sprinkling soft, sparkly dream dust from her fluffy edges]
Luna would sprinkle her special dream dust, made of moonbeams and starlight.

[SCENE: Dream dust falling gently over houses, glowing softly]
The dream dust floated down through windows, landing softly on pillows.

[SCENE: A child yawning and closing their eyes, a peaceful smile on their face]
When children breathed in the dream dust, their eyes would grow heavy and sleepy.

[SCENE: Luna creating shapes in the sky - a bunny, a butterfly, a smiling moon]
Luna would make shapes in the sky - bunnies, butterflies, and smiling moons - for children to dream about.

[SCENE: Children sleeping peacefully, with dream bubbles showing happy dreams above their heads]
Soon, every child in the village was dreaming happy dreams - of adventures and friends.

[SCENE: Luna yawning herself, settling down on a pile of soft clouds like a bed]
When her work was done, Luna would find a cozy spot in the sky and rest too.

[SCENE: The night sky full of peaceful, sleeping clouds and twinkling stars]
All the clouds would sleep together, keeping watch over the dreaming world below.

[SCENE: Luna floating peacefully with a gentle smile, surrounded by stars]
The end. Close your eyes now, little one. Luna is sending you sweet dreams tonight.
