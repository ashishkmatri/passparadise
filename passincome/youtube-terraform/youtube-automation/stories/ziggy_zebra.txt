Title: Ziggy Zebra's Special Stripes

[SCENE: African savanna with a herd of zebras, all with similar black and white stripes]
On the golden African savanna, a herd of zebras lived together happily.

[SCENE: A young zebra with slightly different stripes - some are wavy instead of straight]
Young Ziggy was a little different. Some of his stripes were wavy instead of straight.

[SCENE: Other young zebras pointing at Ziggy's stripes and whispering]
The other young zebras would sometimes stare. "Why do your stripes wiggle?" they asked.

[SCENE: Ziggy looking at his reflection in a waterhole with a sad expression]
Ziggy looked at his reflection in the waterhole. "Why can't I look like everyone else?"

[SCENE: A wise old elephant watching Ziggy from nearby, with kind eyes]
A wise old elephant named Ella had been watching. She walked over slowly.

[SCENE: Ella showing Ziggy that her ears are slightly different sizes]
"See my ears?" Ella said. "One is bigger than the other. It's what makes me, me!"

[SCENE: Ella pointing out different animals with unique features - a giraffe with extra spots, a bird with colorful feathers]
She showed him a giraffe with extra spots, and a bird with rainbow feathers. Everyone was different!

[SCENE: Ziggy looking at his wavy stripes with new eyes, starting to smile]
"Your wavy stripes are like nature's artwork," Ella said. "There's no one else in the world like you!"

[SCENE: Ziggy proudly showing off his stripes to other zebras who now look admiring]
Ziggy stood tall. His wavy stripes were special, not strange. They told his unique story!

[SCENE: Other young zebras asking Ziggy to play, accepting him with smiles]
Soon, the other zebras stopped staring and started admiring. "Your stripes are so cool, Ziggy!"

[SCENE: Ziggy running happily with the herd, his wavy stripes flowing in the wind]
Ziggy galloped across the savanna with his head held high, proud of every single stripe.

[SCENE: A beautiful sunset over the savanna with Ziggy standing proud]
The end. Remember, what makes you different makes you wonderful!
