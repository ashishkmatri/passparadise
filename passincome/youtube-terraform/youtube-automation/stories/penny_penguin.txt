Title: Penny the Penguin Makes a Friend

[SCENE: A snowy Antarctic landscape with many penguins huddled together]
In the frozen land of Antarctica, where the snow sparkled like diamonds, lived many penguins together.

[SCENE: A small penguin standing alone, looking shy while other penguins play]
Little Penny was the shyest penguin of all. She wanted to play with the others but didn't know how to ask.

[SCENE: Penny watching other penguins sliding down an icy hill, laughing and having fun]
Every day, she watched the other penguins slide down the icy hills and play in the snow.

[SCENE: Penny hiding behind an ice block, peeking out nervously]
"What if they don't like me?" Penny worried. "What if I say the wrong thing?"

[SCENE: A colorful puffin landing near Penny, looking friendly and curious]
One day, a little puffin named Pablo flew in from far away. He was new and didn't know anyone either.

[SCENE: Pablo looking around confused, while other penguins stare at his colorful beak]
Pablo felt different with his colorful beak. The penguins had never seen a bird quite like him.

[SCENE: Penny walking up to Pablo nervously, offering a small fish]
Penny saw Pablo sitting alone. She knew how that felt. Taking a deep breath, she waddled over.

[SCENE: Penny and Pablo sharing the fish and smiling at each other]
"Hi, I'm Penny. Would you like to share my fish?" she asked quietly. Pablo's face lit up with joy!

[SCENE: Penny and Pablo sliding down the icy hill together, laughing]
Soon, Penny and Pablo were sliding down hills together, laughing and having the best time.

[SCENE: Other penguins joining Penny and Pablo, everyone playing together]
The other penguins saw how much fun they were having and asked to join. Penny smiled - of course!

[SCENE: A big group of penguins and Pablo playing together in the snow]
Penny learned that making friends starts with being a friend. Sometimes, others are just as shy as you!

[SCENE: Penny and Pablo standing together as best friends, with a beautiful sunset over the ice]
The end. Remember, the best way to find a friend is to be a friend first!
