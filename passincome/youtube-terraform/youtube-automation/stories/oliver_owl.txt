Title: Oliver Owl and the Night Light

[SCENE: A cozy tree hollow at night with a baby owl peeking out nervously]
In a tall oak tree lived a little owl named Oliver. Unlike other owls, Oliver was afraid of the dark.

[SCENE: Other owls flying happily in the moonlit sky while Oliver watches from his hollow]
"Owls are supposed to love the night!" his parents said. But Oliver couldn't help feeling scared.

[SCENE: Oliver covering his eyes with his wings as shadows dance on the walls]
Every night, the shadows seemed to move and dance. Oliver would hide under his wings and wait for morning.

[SCENE: A kind firefly named Flicker glowing softly near Oliver's tree]
One evening, a friendly firefly named Flicker flew by. "Why do you look so sad, little owl?"

[SCENE: Oliver explaining his fear to Flicker, looking embarrassed]
"I'm afraid of the dark," Oliver whispered. "But please don't tell anyone. Owls aren't supposed to be scared."

[SCENE: Flicker lighting up brightly with a warm smile]
Flicker smiled kindly. "Everyone is afraid of something. Would you like me to show you something beautiful?"

[SCENE: Flicker leading Oliver out of his tree, Oliver taking his first nervous steps]
Oliver took a deep breath and followed Flicker out of his cozy hollow for the first time at night.

[SCENE: A magical forest scene with hundreds of fireflies creating beautiful light patterns]
The forest was full of fireflies! They danced and twinkled like stars among the trees. It was magical!

[SCENE: Oliver flying among the fireflies, his eyes wide with wonder]
"The dark isn't scary," Flicker said. "It's just where the most beautiful lights can shine!"

[SCENE: Oliver discovering he can see perfectly in the dark, spotting a mouse far below]
Oliver realized he could see everything perfectly! His owl eyes were made for the night.

[SCENE: Oliver flying confidently through the moonlit forest with Flicker beside him]
From then on, Oliver loved the night. He would fly with Flicker and discover new wonders.

[SCENE: Oliver perched proudly on a branch, the moon glowing behind him]
The end. Remember, sometimes the things we fear the most can become the things we love!
