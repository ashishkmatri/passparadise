Title: Rudy the Little Reindeer's Christmas Eve

[SCENE: The North Pole with Santa's workshop surrounded by snow and twinkling lights]
At the North Pole, Santa's workshop was busy on Christmas Eve. Toys were ready to deliver!

[SCENE: A small reindeer with a slightly glowing nose standing alone, looking uncertain]
Little Rudy was the youngest reindeer. His nose glowed a tiny bit, but not as bright as the others said it should.

[SCENE: The older reindeer lined up in front of Santa's sleigh, looking magnificent]
The bigger reindeer were ready to fly. They had practiced all year for this special night.

[SCENE: Rudy watching from the side, wishing he could help pull the sleigh]
"I wish I could help," Rudy whispered, watching from the stable. He was too small and his light too dim.

[SCENE: A thick fog rolling in over the North Pole, covering everything in white]
Suddenly, a thick fog rolled in! No one could see anything - not even the runway!

[SCENE: Santa looking worried as the reindeer can't find their way in the fog]
"Oh no!" said Santa. "How will we deliver presents if we can't see where we're going?"

[SCENE: Rudy's nose starting to glow brighter as he feels how much Christmas needs him]
Rudy's little heart swelled with love for all the children waiting for Christmas. His nose began to glow brighter!

[SCENE: Rudy's nose now shining like a bright red beacon, cutting through the fog]
Brighter and brighter it glowed, until it shone like a beautiful red star! It cut right through the fog!

[SCENE: Santa placing Rudy at the front of the reindeer team, everyone cheering]
"Rudy! You can guide us!" Santa cheered. Rudy was placed at the very front of the team!

[SCENE: The sleigh flying through the foggy night sky, guided by Rudy's glowing nose]
Off they flew into the night! Rudy's bright nose lit the way to every house around the world.

[SCENE: Children waking up on Christmas morning to find presents under their trees]
Thanks to Rudy, every child got their presents that Christmas morning!

[SCENE: Rudy sleeping peacefully with the other reindeer, finally part of the team]
The end. Remember, sometimes what makes us different is exactly what the world needs!
